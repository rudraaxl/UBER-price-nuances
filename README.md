# UBER-price-nuances
it is a data analysis and machine learning pipeline for a dynamic pricing scenario related to ridesharing or transportation services
The goal have been to develop a dynamic pricing strategy that adjusts ride prices based on factors such as demand, supply, ride duration, and historical costs. The code calculates demand and supply multipliers, adjusts ride costs dynamically, and evaluates the profitability of rides.


Import Libraries:

pandas for data manipulation and analysis.
plotly.express and plotly.graph_objects for creating interactive visualizations.
numpy for numerical computations.
StandardScaler from sklearn.preprocessing for data preprocessing.
train_test_split from sklearn.model_selection for splitting the data into training and testing sets.
RandomForestRegressor from sklearn.ensemble for training a random forest regression model.
Load and Explore Data:

Load data from a CSV file named "dynamic_pricing.csv" into a Pandas DataFrame (data).
Display the first few rows of the DataFrame using print(data.head()).
Display summary statistics of the data using print(data.describe()).
Data Visualization:

Create a scatter plot and a box plot using Plotly Express to visualize relationships between different variables in the data.
Create a correlation matrix heatmap using Plotly Graph Objects to visualize correlations between variables.
Data Preprocessing:

Define a function data_preprocessing_pipeline to preprocess the data by handling missing values, outliers, and categorical features.
Feature Engineering:

Convert categorical feature "Vehicle_Type" into numeric values (1 for "Premium" and 0 for "Economy").
Split the data into input features (x) and target variable (y).
Split the data further into training and testing sets using train_test_split.
Model Training:

Train a Random Forest Regression model (model) using the training data (x_train and y_train).
Prediction and Evaluation:

Define a function predict_price to predict ride prices based on user input.
Make predictions using the trained model for a sample user input.
Evaluate the model's performance by comparing actual vs. predicted values on the test set and visualizing the results using a scatter plot.
